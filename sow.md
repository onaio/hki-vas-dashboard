###HKI VAS Dashboard:

a) A map comparing the following indicators in all HKI country offices that have conducted PEC surveys, 
divided by country office. The map should provide visualization of the below indicators, and coverage
should be coded to include 3 levels (Red < 80%, Yellow 80-89%, Green 90-100%). If possible, data
should also be able to be visualized by VAS coverage (e.g countries with â‰¥ 80% coverage vs. countries with < 80%  coverage.

* Vitamin A 6-59 months
* Vitamin A 6-11 months
* Vitamin A 12-59 months

* Vitamin A coverage by gender
* How caretaker heard about campaign
* Knowledge of Vitamin A by caretakers
* Knowledge of Vitamin A by health workers
* Where received vitamin A
* Location of health centers compared with coverage

 Map characteristics: Country lines should be clearly defined, incorporating the delineations made on the 
 country pages.

 The system should allow the ability to view by year and by each PECS survey round (e.g Round 1 2012, Round
 2 2012, Round 1 2013, Round 2 2013).

 The system should allow the ability to upload cleaned .csv data with an option to view the indicators on a 
 live form as they are coming in.

b) Country Web Pages: Map of coverage in 7 HKI countries currently using formhub platform (transitioning to Ona Data Platform. The map should represent percent coverage, with a secondary focus on sample size and # of households covered. Country maps should provide visualization of indicators included on the Regional map, they should also clearly define the region of the PECS conducted along with coverage.

c) Visual representation of summary statistics: Each country page and the regional page should include a dynamic visual representation of summary statistics of the PECs survey, as well as a table or option to view historic data.
