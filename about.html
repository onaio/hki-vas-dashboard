        <p>
            <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>

            Helen Keller International (HKI) has been at the forefront of the development and scaling 
            up of strategies to effectively deliver vitamin A supplementation since the early 1970s.   
            In partnership with government Ministries of Health, UNICEF, Micronutrient Initiative, and 
            other partners, vitamin A supplementation has since become a pillar in all 13 sub-Saharan 
            Africa countries where HKI works.  In these countries, vitamin A supplementation is distributed 
            twice-yearly through Child Health Days, in addition to routine distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
            All countries implementing Child Health Days use tally sheet data to measure coverage, which is the 
            same method used to measure vaccine coverage.  This method consistently over-estimates coverage due 
            to inaccurate census data, mathematical errors totaling coverage across districts and regions, and 
            distribution of capsules outside of the target age group.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Since 2011, HKI has conducted over 40 post-event coverage surveys (PECs) in 13 countries to validate 
            coverage reported by tally sheets.  The interactive map on this website provides a summary of coverage 
            data from tally sheets and PECS broken down by country and by catchment area.  Using the map, coverage 
            can be compared over time and across countries, and the difference between administrative data and PECs 
            validated data can be viewed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>WHAT IS A POST EVENT COVERAGE SURVEY?</h4>

            A post-event coverage survey (PECs) is a household survey used to verify administrative or tally sheet 
            coverage data following a distribution event or campaign.  PECS are also used to evaluate the quality of 
            service delivery and determine factors that affected coverage and knowledge about services distributed. 
            PECs are conducted within six weeks of service distribution in order to ensure accurate recall.
        </p>
        <p>
            The target groups for PECs are parents and caretakers of children who were eligible to receive services 
            during the distribution.  Community leaders, facility-based health workers, distributors, community health 
            workers and other individuals involved in the distribution can also be surveyed as their knowledge and 
            perspectives provide insight into how distribution programs can be strengthened.
        </p>
        <p>
            PECS methodology is based on the World Health Organization methodology for immunization coverage surveys. 
            In each PECs, 900 caretakers are surveyed from 30 different clusters and asked if their child received the 
            service of interest.  The selection of 30 clusters and 30 households per cluster is used to achieve a precise 
            and rapid estimate of service coverage with +/- 5% accuracy.
